						<p >The first Bonnaroo took place in 2002. The founders chose "bonnaroo," a Creole slang word meaning "a really good time," for its literal meaning and to honor the rich New Orleans music tradition they had enjoyed in college.Main attractions of this festival are the multiple stages featuring live music with a diverse array of musical styles including indie rock, classic rock, world music, hip hop, jazz, americana, bluegrass, country music, folk, gospel, reggae, pop, electronica, and other alternative music. </p>
